      "Whisk It All is a professional business website designed to showcase the services and offerings of a local business. The website features a clean and modern design, with easy navigation and a focus on user experience. It includes sections for the business's story, services, testimonials, and contact information, all presented in a visually appealing manner. This project was a collaboration with the business owner, where I took the lead on the design and development aspects. My goal was to create a website that not only looks great but also effectively communicates the brand's message.",

    fullDescription:
      "Home Doc is a health insight platform powered by AI (Llama3), designed to provide a Symptom Checker for quick, preliminary health assessments. Users can input their age, gender, and symptoms to receive personalized insights, with the reminder to consult a healthcare professional for definitive diagnoses. This project began as a concept app during a hackathon, where I collaborated with two teammates. Although we couldn't complete it in time, I later took the initiative to finish the prototype independently. My primary role was implementing the AI functionality, but I also developed the frontend and backend, transforming it into a comprehensive personal project.",
