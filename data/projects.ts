    fullDescription:
      "Home Doc is a health insight platform powered by AI (Llama3), designed to provide a Symptom Checker for quick, preliminary health assessments. Users can input their age, gender, and symptoms to receive personalized insights, with the reminder to consult a healthcare professional for definitive diagnoses. This project began as a concept app during a hackathon, where I collaborated with two teammates. Although we couldn't complete it in time, I later took the initiative to finish the prototype independently. My primary role was implementing the AI functionality, but I also developed the frontend and backend, transforming it into a comprehensive personal project.",
